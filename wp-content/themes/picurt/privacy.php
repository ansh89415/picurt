                <p>Our mission is to help you discover art, meet artists, and learn from their experiences. To do so, we may show you personalized content and ads we think you’ll be interested in. We wrote this policy to help you understand what information we collect, what pictures or content we use and what choices you have about it. Because we’re an internet company and we provide services only through internet. However, some of the concepts below might be little technical, but we’ve tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way. </p>

               <div>
                 
                <ol type="1">
                  
                  <li>Permissions & data we get: When you sign up for or use Picurt, you give us certain information voluntarily. This includes your name, email address, profile photo, artworks, and any other information you give us. If you link your Facebook or Google account or any URL from other third party services to Picurt, we also get information from those accounts (such as your friends or contacts). The information we get from those services depends on your settings and their privacy policies, so please check what those are.</li>

                  <li>Whenever you use any website, mobile application or other internet service, certain information gets created and logged automatically. The same is true when you use Picurt. Here are some of the types of information we collect:
                  Log data. When you use Picurt, our servers record information including information that your browser automatically sends whenever you visit a website. This log data includes your Internet Protocol address, the address of and activity on websites you visit, settings, the date and time of your request, how you used Picurt, cookie data and device data.

                  Cookie data.  We also use “cookies” or similar technologies to capture log data. When we use cookies or other similar technologies, we use session cookies (that last until you close your browser) or persistent cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Picurt account (including information about you, such as the email address you gave us) and other cookies are not. 

                  Device information. In addition to log data, we collect information about the device you’re using Picurt on, including type of device, operating system, settings, unique device identifiers and crash data that helps us understand when something breaks. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings.
 
                  </li>

                  <li>Online advertisers or third parties share information with us to measure or improve the performance of ads on Picurt, or to figure out what kinds of ads to show you. This includes information about your visits to an advertiser's site or purchases you made from them, or information about your interests from a third party service, which we might use to help show you ads.</li>

                  <li>We use the information we collect to provide the Service to you. We commit to showing you content that’s relevant, interesting and personal to you. In order to do that, it’s necessary for us to use your information to: 
                  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                    <li>Identify you when you use Picurt, and process your transactions.</li>
                    <li>Recommend art categories or artists you might like based on your activity on Picurt. </li>
                  </ul>  

                  In addition and for similar reasons, we have a legitimate interest in using your information in these ways. It is also fundamental to the nature of the Service we provide. In short, it’s necessary for us to do these things in order to make the Service relevant, interesting and personal to you like we promised. We also have a legitimate interest to improve Picurt, maintain our relationship with you, and protect users. We both benefit when we use your information to:
                    
                    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                      
                      <li>Suggest other people who have similar interests. </li>
                      <li>Help your friends and contacts find via Picurt. </li>
                      <li>Conduct analytics on who is using Picurt and what they are doing</li>
                      <li>Improve Picurt and offer new features.</li>
                      <li>Send you updates (such as when certain activity, like profiles, happens on Picurt) and news by email, depending on your settings. </li>
                      <li>Work with law enforcement and keep Picurt safe. We may get requests for account information from law enforcement authorities like the police or courts</li>
                    </ul>

                    We have a legitimate interest in delivering ads that are relevant, interesting and personal to you in order to generate revenue. To further these interests we use the information we collect to: 

                    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                      <li>Decide which ads to show you</li>
                      <li>Tell our ad partners how their Picurt ads are doing, and how to make them better. Some of this information is aggregated. </li>
                      <li>Tell our ad partners the types of products you might be interested in. </li>
                    </ul>

                    We have a legitimate interest in using information we collect to customize your Picurt experience based on your offsite behavior. In addition to the specific circumstances above, we’ll only use your information with your consent in order to:

                   <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                    
                    <li>Send you marketing materials by email, depending on your account or operating system settings. </li>
                    <li>Identify your location and customize the content we show you.</li>
                  
                   </ul>

                   We’ll also rely on your consent where we use cookies to:

                   <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                     <li>Identify you across different browser sessions. This means if you log into Picurt from your phone (or any device), we'll remember that you're you and you won't need to enter your login details each time you visit Picurt.</li>
                     <li>Show you ads you might be interested in. </li>
                   </ul>


                  </li>



                  <li>Picurt is a worldwide service. By using Picurt, you authorize us to transfer and store your information outside your home country. The privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your information in these countries may not be the same as in your home country.</li>

                  <li>Our goal is to give you simple and meaningful choices regarding your information. If you have a Picurt account, many of the choices you have on Picurt are built directly into Picurt or your settings. For example, you can edit information in your profile at any time.</li>

                  <li>Anyone can see the artworks and the profile information you give us. We also make this public information available through what are called APIs (basically a technical way to share information quickly). Some of the ways we use your information require us to share information with third parties, so we can provide your Picurt experience, make sure our customization is effective and comply with laws that apply to us. We share your information with:
                  
                  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">

                  <li>Other services when you decide to link your Picurt account to those services or publish your activity on Picurt to them. </li>
                  <li>Online advertisers and third party companies that we or they use to audit or improve the delivery and performance of ads or content on websites and apps (for example, through Google Analytics). </li>
                  <li>Third party companies or individuals that we employ to process information on our behalf based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. </li>
                  <li>We only share information if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Picurt; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</li>
                  <li>Our wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliates. If we were to engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy, we would share your information with a party involved in such a process.</li>

                  </ul>





                  </li>

                  <li>Children under 13 are not allowed to use Picurt.</li>
                  <li>We may change this policy from time to time and if we do, we’ll post any changes on this page. If you continue to use Picurt after those changes are in effect, you agree to the new policy. If the changes are significant, we may provide a more prominent notice or get your consent, as required by law.</li>
